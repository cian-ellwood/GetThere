	<p1>Our project is a time management app. The app will give incentives to the user to arrive on time for college or school. Each student will have an account which will contain their academic timetable and the way in which they travel to college/school.</p1>
    </br>
   </br>
    <p1>The student will check-in to their college or school using the  app. The app will then know if they are on time or late by referring to their  timetable and if their bus was on time. The app will give rewards to the student for being on time. One example of a reward is a 10% discount on a certain drink in a local coffee shop.</p1>
